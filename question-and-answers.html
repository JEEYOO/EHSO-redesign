   <div id='title-1' class='tab-content' style ='display:none'>According to the publication "The Guardian: Origins of the EPA," President Nixon declared his intention to establish the Environmental Protection Agency with Reorganization Plan Number 3, dated July 9, 1970. The EPA's mission would include:<p>"The establishment and enforcement of environmental protection standards consistent with national environmental goals... The conduct of research on the adverse effects of pollution and on methods and equipment for controlling it; the gathering of information on pollution; and the use of this information in strengthening environmental protection programs and recommending policy changes... assisting others, through grants, technical assistance and other means, in arresting pollution of the environment... assisting the Council on Environmental Quality in developing and recommending to the President new policies for the protection of the environment."</p><p>After being cleared through hearings in the Senate and House of Representatives, the EPA came into being on December 2, 1970.</p><p>You can obtain a copy of this publication free-of-charge by calling the National Service Center for Environmental Publications (NSCEP, formerly NCEPI) at 1-800-490-9198.

The mission of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is to protect human health and to safeguard the natural environment--air, water, and land--upon which life depends.

<p><b>EPA's purpose is to ensure that: </b></p>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>All Americans are protected from significant risks to human health and the environment where they live, learn and work.</li>
  <li>National efforts to reduce environmental risk are based on the best available scientific information.</li>
  <li>Federal laws protecting human health and the environment are enforced fairly and effectively.</li>
  <li>Environmental protection is an integral consideration in U.S. policies concerning natural resources, human health, economic growth, energy, transportation, agriculture, industry, and international trade, and these factors are similarly considered in establishing environmental policy.</li>
  <li>All parts of society--communities, individuals, business, state and local governments, tribal governments--have access to accurate information sufficient to effectively participate in managing human health and environmental risks.</li>
  <li>Environmental protection contributes to making our communities and ecosystems diverse, sustainable and economically productive.</li>
  <li>The United States plays a leadership role in working with other nations to protect the global environment.</li>

Public Health And The Environment</h1>

For more information on EPA goals and Agency approaches to achieving its goals, see the <a href="http://www.ehso.com/ehso.php?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov/ocfopage/plan/plan.htm" target="-top">EPA Strategic Plan
</a>.

<p><b>CLEAN AIR</b>: The air in every American community will be safe and healthy to breathe. In particular, children, the elderly, and people with respiratory ailments will be protected from health risks of breathing polluted air. Reducing air pollution will also protect the environment, resulting in many benefits, such as restoring life in damaged ecosystems and reducing health risks to those whose subsistence depends directly on those ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>CLEAN AND SAFE WATER</b>: All Americans will have drinking water that is clean and safe to drink. Effective protection of America's rivers, lakes, wetlands, aquifers, and coastal and ocean waters will sustain fish, plants, and wildlife, as well as recreational, subsistence, and economic activities. Watersheds and their aquatic ecosystems will be restored and protected to improve public health, enhance water quality, reduce flooding, and provide habitat for wildlife.</p>

<p><b>SAFE FOOD</b>: The foods Americans eat will be free from unsafe pesticide residues. Children especially will be protected from the health threats posed by pesticide residues, because they are among the most vulnerable groups in our society.</p>

<p><b>PREVENTING POLLUTION AND REDUCING RISK IN COMMUNITIES, HOMES, WORKPLACES AND ECOSYSTEMS</b>: Pollution prevention and risk management strategies aimed at cost-effectively eliminating, reducing, or minimizing emissions and contamination will result in cleaner and safer environments in which all Americans can reside, work, and enjoy life. EPA will safeguard ecosystems and promote the health of natural communities that are integral to the quality of life in this nation.</p>

<p><b>REDUCTION OF GLOBAL AND CROSS-BORDER ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS</b>: The United States will lead other nations in successful, multilateral efforts to reduce significant risks to human health and ecosystems from climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and other hazards of international concern.</p>

<p><b>EXPANSION OF AMERICANS' RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR ENVIRONMENT</b>: Easy access to a wealth of information about the state of their local environment will expand citizen involvement and give people tools to protect their families and their communities as they see fit. Increased information exchange between scientists, public health officials, businesses, citizens, and all levels of government will foster greater knowledge about the environment and what can be done to protect it.</p>

<p><b>SOUND SCIENCE, IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF ENVIRONMENTAL RISK, AND GREATER INNOVATION TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS</b>: EPA will develop and apply the best available science for addressing current and future environmental hazards, as well as new approaches toward improving environmental protection.</p>

<p><b>A CREDIBLE DETERRENT TO POLLUTION AND GREATER COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW</b>: EPA will ensure full compliance with laws intended to protect human health and the environment.</p>

<b>EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT</b>: EPA will establish a management infrastructure that will set and implement the highest quality standards for effective internal management and fiscal responsibility.</div>

    <a class='tab' href ="javascript:shide('title-18')">18. Q. What is the federal role of the EPA? </a>
    <div id='title-18' class='tab-content' style ='display:none'>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implements the Federal laws designed to promote public health by protecting our Nation's air, water, and soil from harmful pollution. EPA endeavors to accomplish its mission systematically by proper integration of a variety of research, monitoring, standard-setting, and enforcement activities. As a complement to its other activities, EPA coordinates and supports research and anti-pollution activities of State and local governments, private and public groups, individuals, and educational institutions. EPA also monitors the operations of other Federal agencies with respect to their impact on the environment.

<p>EPA was created through Reorganization Plan #3 of 1970, which was devised to consolidate the Federal Government's environmental regulatory activities into a single agency. The plan was sent by the President to Congress on July 9, 1970, and the Agency began operation on December 2, 1970.</p>

   EPA was formed by bringing together 15 components from 5 executive departments and independent agencies. Air pollution control, solid waste management, radiation control, and the drinking water program were transferred from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). The Federal water pollution control program was taken from the Department of the Interior, as was part of a pesticide research program. From the Department of Agriculture, EPA acquired authority to register pesticides and to regulate their use, and from the Food and Drug Administration inherited the responsibility to set tolerance levels for pesticides in food. EPA was assigned some responsibility for setting environmental radiation protection standards from the Atomic Energy Commission, and absorbed the duties of the Federal Radiation Council</div>
